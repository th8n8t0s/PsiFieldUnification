 Ψ-Field Unification Framework

This project explores a scalar coherence field Ψ(x, t) that encodes spacetime curvature and dynamically couples to quantum fields. Unlike traditional formulations that rely on full tensor-based general relativity, this model:

- Computes Einstein tensor components \( G_{\mu\nu} \) from Ψ curvature alone
- Couples Ψ to scalar, vector, and spinor fields using a unified Lagrangian
- Simulates decoherence, entanglement, and energy density behavior in Ψ-curved space
- Recovers both general relativity (GR) and quantum field theory (QFT) in limiting cases

Entirely symbolic and numerical — no supercomputer or GR libraries needed.


Why This Matters

Most unification efforts rely on:
- String theory, extra dimensions, or unknown particles
- Heavy tensor frameworks and HPC infrastructure

This project shows a scalar-based model can replicate key gravitational and quantum behaviors in a simulation-ready form — hinting at possible curvature-compression or geometric duality mechanisms.
