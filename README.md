# PsiFieldUnification
 This project explores a scalar field Ψ(x, t) whose gradients generate spacetime curvature and dynamically couple to scalar, vector, and spinor fields via a unified Lagrangian.  It recovers Einstein-like curvature, QFT limits, and predicts decoherence anomalies under curvature — all simulated without tensor libraries or HPC.
